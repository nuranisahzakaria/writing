        You don't have to try to become anyone else
        you just being you. No matter who you are,
        no matter where you come from, you are the 
        one and only.
        That's what makes you beautiful and special 
        in you're own ways.
        And no matter what you are facing right now,
        and I don't know no matter what the future 
        holds for you.
        Please never change yourself, love yoursself,
        accept yourself and than transform yourself.
