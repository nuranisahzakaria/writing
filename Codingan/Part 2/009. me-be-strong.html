        <p>
            When people think that we're independent
            because that's what we showed to them. <br>
            We don't show our emotions too often. <br>
            We act like we don't care at all on what 
            people will say about us or how they will
            treat us. <br>
            We're acting like is not a big deal but 
            apparently, it kill us slowly as we 
            denying it :'(
