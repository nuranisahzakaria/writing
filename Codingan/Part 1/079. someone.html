            Sometimes beautiful people come into your 
            life for only a reason of time simply to 
            show you that good people exist.
        </p>
        <p>
            They come to rewind you that love is worth 
            fighting for, that there are people in 
            this world who will see you for who you 
            truly are. They come to teach you how to
            love yourself, to nudge you in the right 
            direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            And oftentimes, these people leave just as 
            quickly they came.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let them go with love. <br>
            They were never yours to keep.
